<h1>Local football players' laziness motivates Morisson to seek to turn out for Taifa Stars</h1>
<img src="morisson.jpg"alt=image here" height="600" width"600">
<h2>By Correspondent Nassir Nchimbi</h2>
<p>GHANANIAN midfielder Benard Morrison does not run out of either stunts or funny words, he is a player that is most talked about as fer as Tanzanian media is concerned, there are many words to describe him.</p>
<p>Recently I saw a video somewhere showing Morrison  asking the president of the United Republic Of Tanzania Mama Samia Suluhu Hassan to grant him Tanzanian citizenship so that he can play for the country’s senior national team “Taifa Stars” .</p>
<p>I think he has given up on playing for the Ghananian National Team but then he claimed that he loves Tanzania. I know Morrison is serious and his prayers can be stressed in two dimensions.</p>
<p>The first is that which keeps surprising Tanzanian in the way they find in strange that a sportsman is given citizenship, for us citizenship is something difficult and strange. It is like some Tanzanian have continued to blame Simba SC attacker Kibu Denis on the ground of discriminating against his citizenship, others  will be heard saying  ‘they do not know why he was granted citizenship.</p>
<p>For Tanzanians, citizenship is a real deal, they are not surprised to see that it is to other countries, quite normal. Many Tanzanians have been granted citizenship in other counties for different reason. Some lived a long time in the countries, there are those gifted athletes, and there are those who lucky enough to apply citizenship and were granted.</p>
<p>In support, various stars have been granted citizenship in countries with the difficult process of getting it.
Some Brazilians have been given Japanese citizenship to represent Japan’s national team. Some Brazilians have also been given Tunisian citizenship and plays for Tunisia’s national team. The current generation of French has two types of black players were born to Africa and some players went when they were young and were granted citizenship. They including Patrick Vieira and Patrice Evra, which is a common thing in other countries. Some Kenyan athletes have been granted citizenship in the United Arab Emirates for representing the later in high profile showdown.</p>
<p>This is nothing strange. Even if Morrison prays it can’t be miracle. Tanzanian think it is something strange because most of us have not traveled enough and gone to other countries where you will find this thing is normal. However, despite Morrison want to be granted Tanzania citizenship, there are still basic issues that have to be discussed. Sometimes a section of Tanzanians wanted former Azam FC attacker, Ivory Coast national kipper Tchetche, to be given Tanzanian citizenship to help the nation team. </p>
<p>The truth is that Tanzania will not achieve success in football because of giving people citizenship to play the nation team. Morrison wants to play for the nation team because he sees he had an opportunity to turn out for the squad, and the midfielder can play for nation teams in the East African region.</p>
<p>I think he has seen it, however, in our case, giving foreign players citizenship is not a solution.
The country has to start looking at where it has stumbled, in the past there were many players like Morrison but these days they have disappeared. As for the wingers, the country boasted of gifted footballers who can hold the ball and skillfully dribble past defenders. There were;
<ul>
<li>Celestien `Sikinde’</li>
<li>Mbunga</li>
<li>Edibily Lunyamila</li>
<li>Hussein Mwakuruzo</li>
<li>Justin Mtekere</li>
<li>Omary Hussein `Keegen’</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Where have these players gone? It has come to a point  now that simba SC introduced there new striker, Habib Kyombo but the side’s fans are complaining. The enthusiasts  want to have their outfits rope in foreign stars, soon  this matter will move to the national team. Tanzanians should ask where did the country stumble ? There are many issues one of them is clubs hardly produce gifted players. The government through schools ‘sports, no longer produces quality players are not developing to reach the level that the former players reached.</p>
<p>Tanzania’s football legend, Sunday Manara, once said that the difference between the old players and the current players line in dedication, they have talents. The difference is that today’s players play at 40 percent of their ability but during Manara’s era players used to play 90 percent of their ability.</p>
<p>Domestic football followers known players are very talented but they hardly worry about themselves. These are the ones who have give Morrison the pride to aspire to play for the national team. If the footballer would have met a man called Lunyamila he would never have wished to play for the nation team. As a result, today  Simba SC and Yanga SC depend on foreign players, if a person monitors this season’s registration, many modest clubs have also started to emulate the two sides.</p>
<p>It is just the movement of foreign players, and individuals can hardly blame the clubs because they want success. When Simba SC signed forward Yusuph Mhilu, the squad thought he could reach at least half of Mozambican Luis Miquissone’s potential but such an expectation has not been fulfilled. If a soccer enthusiast wants to see that the country is losing track, he/she can only measure that former midfielder   Mrisho Ngassa played well compared midfielder Denis Nkane.</p>
<p>Morrison can play to Tanzanian national team but he is not the solution to the side’s problems. Nowadays reliable talent is no longer produced as was the case in the past, this came about once I heard that the country is forced to search for the footballer of Tanzanian origin who are playing in Europe.</p>
<p>These are not the solutions, there is a need to go back to the basics, focus should be on grooming players who are self-aware and hard working. There are good local footballers but unfortunately, they are only playing a little percent of their potential. Good luck for them in the coming years, they get more money, a situation which  makes them rest on their laurels and opt of working Hard. </p>
