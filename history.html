<h2>Young African sports club history</h2>
</center>
<center>
<p>
People can trace young African FC roots as early as 1910. Like many other football clubs in Africa, the Young Africans sports club started humbly as a community football club in Jangwani Dar es Salaam. Over the years, the club's popularity grew. It was officially recognized and registered in 1935. When the local community who were categorized as Africans by the British colonial administration decided to officially create a club that will compete with non-Africans football clubs in a well-structured league. The name was given to this football club when the club officially started. It was New Young. But it was later changed to Dar es Salaam Young African SC and finally to the Young African sports club.

Just two years after the club was officially established, things did not go well for the club. The club recorded a poor performance and widespread dissatisfaction among team members and club supporters. That resulted in some of the club members splitting and forming a rival team known as Queens Football Club, popularly known as samba. Since then, these two football teams, Yanga, and Simba have been fierce rivals.

<h2>Young Africans SC in premier league</h2>
</center>
<p>
The young African football club has not won the converted premier league title over the last four years. The league has been dominated by the fierce rival Simba FC, which seems to be getting even stronger by the season. However, Young African sports club manager Mr. Nasreddine Nabi has vowed that the club will lift the premier league trophy next season, which is about to commence soon. The manager admitted that their fans have not been impressed with the fact that the club has not won the premier league title over the last four seasons and has promised to bring the Jangwani giants back to where they belong.

<p>
And from the steps that the club has taken, including buying new talented players and bringing new coach, and changing their tactical staff, it seems that the sleeping giant is serious to go back to their former glory. Whether Young African FC will win the premier league title or not is a game of wait and see. However, the head coach is confident that the team and the technical staff have all learned their mistakes the hard way and are convinced that the changes made over the recent time will yield fruits this coming season.
</p>
<p>
"Young Africans SC was in a transition period. And we are satisfied with what we have done since I took over will yield fruits. Our fan will be happy next season because we are taking our crown back." Mr. Nasreddine Nabi said while speaking to the media.

According to the draw conducted on Friday at CAF headquarters in curio, young African FC (official site) is set to return to the continental scene with a class with Nigeria's Rivers United. On the other hand, young Africans SC that is making a comeback to this elite competition after finishing second in the league have their eyes set on the prize and is to win the title from the defending champions, Al Ahly of Egypt.
